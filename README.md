# the_matrix_public - algorithmic trading system
This repo is stripped down version from my private one that I am working on. Crates likely wouldn't complie because I removed significant amount of code that I don't want to open source. It is still in early stage of development.

Users can define their own trading model. We can optimize models to achieve highest profits and deploy them on live markets.

## Some key technologies
- OpenCL for model definition and optimization (hidden)
- REST client (nebuchadnezzar)
- Stream/batch processing (zion)
- Game engine (Bevy) for data visualization (tank)
- Live execution (matrix)
